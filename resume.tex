\header{Work History}

\employer{Ride \\ Senior Software Engineer}{December 2014 - November 2016}{Backend \& Architecture}

\bigskip

Ride was a ride-sharing company, where companies with big headquarters benefited from their employees
sharing their own cars to go to work. It was used at places like Stanford and Delta Airlines.

\smallskip

As a senior software engineer at Ride I was involved most backend systems including API, billing and trip management.
The API and billing systems were built on Ruby. The trip management service was built in Go.

\bigskip

\begin{achievements}

\item Integrated the algorithms designed by the R\&D department with our production systems (managed by the Engineering team) and make it robust and scalable.
\item Lead the re-architecture of the backend, where several services talked to each other via AMQP or HTTP with a central API that coordinated services and events.
\item Worked on the Trip Management service that alerted passengers when the driver was nearby and automatically triggered billing when they arrived at their destination.

\end{achievements}

\bigskip

\employer{We Heart It \\ Software Engineer}{April 2013 - December 2014}{Backend \& API}

\bigskip

We Heart It is an image based social network with over 30 million users. Users can browse the web and then \textit{heart}
images that they like.

\bigskip

\begin{achievements}
\item Worked on implementing the v2.0 of the API with RESTful endpoints.
\item Built "Inspirations". An automatic collection of images of specific categories.
\item Part of a 4 people team for the backend of We Heart It, built using Ruby (on Rails).
\item Backend runs on multiple technologies including MySQL, Redis, Cassandra & RabbitMQ among others.
\end{achievements}

\bigskip

\employer{Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) \\ Visiting Research Student}{October 2011 - April 2013}{Full-Time Research Student at CECI Lab}

\bigskip

As a visiting research student at CECI lab at MIT, I had the opportunity to work with the iLab platform. A platform created to develop remote laboratories.
The idea behind this is to allow people around the world to run experiments on real labs with real hardware.

\bigskip

\begin{achievements}
\item Develop the Building Energy Efficiency Lab for a Civil Engineering class.
\item Develop a tool to communicate LMS systems with Remote Lab Management Systems.
\item Develop a ruby client to connect to the Weblab Deusto Remote Lab Management System.
\end{achievements}

\bigskip

\employer{EAFIT University (Medell\'in, Colombia) \\ R\&D in Computers in Education}{October 2009 - July 2012}{Part-Time Research Assistant}

The R\&D in Computers in Education worked on improving education via technology. We worked closely with Colombia's Ministry of Education
to share educational activities in remote areas of Colombia.

\begin{achievements}
\item Develop various projects focused on Computers in Education working closely with Colombian's Ministry of Education.
\item Write API guidelines for services in projects for Medell\ín city projects.
\end{achievements}
